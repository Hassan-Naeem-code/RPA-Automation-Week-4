# Flight Booking Automation - Troubleshooting Guide

## Data Assumptions

### Test Data Generation
Our synthetic dataset was created using the `generate_sample_data.py` script with the following characteristics:

- **Base Dataset**: 200 clean flight reservations
- **Final Dataset**: 205 records (including 5 intentional duplicates)
- **Fields**: PNR, Passenger, Origin, Destination, Fare, Status, BookingDate, TravelDate, Email, Phone

### Intentional Edge Cases Introduced

1. **Missing Values**: 
   - 4 missing email addresses
   - 6 missing phone numbers  
   - 4 missing fare values

2. **Data Type Issues**:
   - 6 fare values stored as strings with "$" prefix (e.g., "$2097.46")
   - Mixed data types in Fare column

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - 2 records with same origin and destination
   - 2 records with negative or zero fares

4. **Invalid Codes**:
   - ~3% invalid airport codes (XXX, ZZZ, ABC, etc.)
   - 3 invalid status values (Unknown, Error, Processing)

5. **Duplicates**: 5 exact duplicate records

## Error Analysis and Fixes

### Error 1: String Fare Conversion Failure
**Error**: `ValueError: could not convert string to float: '$697.06'`
**Root Cause**: The data processor tried to convert string fare values like "$697.06" directly to float without handling the "$" symbol.
**Location**: `src/data_processor.py:66` in `_process_single_reservation()`

**Fix Applied**: 
```python
# Before (buggy code)
if isinstance(fare, str):
    fare = float(fare)  # Fails for "$697.06"

# After (fixed code)
if isinstance(fare, str):
    try:
        fare = float(fare.replace('$', ''))
    except ValueError:
        fare = 0.0
```

**Git Commit**: `d7aee63` - "Fix: handle string fare values and improve data validation"

### Error 2: Validation Not Filtering Invalid Records
**Error**: Invalid records were being included in processing despite validation errors
**Root Cause**: The `DataValidator.validate_reservations()` method identified errors but didn't filter out invalid records
**Location**: `src/validation.py:24`

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (buggy code)
if errors:
    self.validation_errors.extend(errors)
    valid_records.append(row)  # Bug: Adding invalid records!

# After (fixed code)
if not errors:  # Only add records with NO errors
    valid_records.append(row)
else:
    self.validation_errors.extend(errors)
```

**Git Commit**: `d7aee63` - "Fix: handle string fare values and improve data validation"

### Error 3: Missing Email Validation
**Error**: Email format was never validated despite having a validation method
**Root Cause**: `_validate_email()` method existed but was never called
**Location**: `src/validation.py:94`

**Fix Applied**: Added email validation call in `_validate_single_record()`

**Git Commit**: `d7aee63` - "Fix: handle string fare values and improve data validation"

### Error 4: Performance Issues
**Error**: 334 seconds runtime for 199 records (1.6 seconds per record)
**Root Cause**: Multiple performance bottlenecks:
- Row-by-row processing with 10ms sleep per record
- Synchronous email sending with 100ms delay between emails
- No vectorized operations

**Git Commits**: 
- `d7aee63` - Initial bug fixes
- `ea05637` - "Optimize: implement vectorized operations and concurrent processing"
- `ff9c9c4` - "Complete: documentation and performance analysis tools"

**Final Status**: 334s → 18.5s (94.5% improvement)

## Performance Optimization Summary

### Optimization Strategies Implemented

#### 1. Vectorized Data Processing
**Before (Row-by-Row)**:
```python
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    processed_record = self._process_single_reservation(row)
    time.sleep(0.01)  # 10ms delay per record
```

**After (Vectorized)**:
```python
def clean_data_optimized(self, data):
    # Remove duplicates
    data_clean = data.drop_duplicates(subset=['PNR'], keep='first')
    
    # Vectorized fare cleaning
    data_clean['Fare'] = data_clean['Fare'].apply(clean_fare)
    
    # Vectorized filtering
    data_clean = data_clean[
        (data_clean['Origin'].isin(valid_airports)) & 
        (data_clean['Destination'].isin(valid_airports)) &
        (data_clean['Origin'] != data_clean['Destination']) &
        (data_clean['Status'].isin(self.valid_statuses)) &
        (data_clean['Fare'] > 0)
    ]
```

**Impact**: Data processing time reduced from ~2.3s to ~0.01s (99.5% improvement)

#### 2. Concurrent Email Processing
**Before (Synchronous)**:
```python
for reservation in reservations_data.iterrows():
    result = self._send_single_confirmation(reservation)
    time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms delay between emails
```

**After (Concurrent)**:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    future_to_reservation = {}
    for reservation in reservations_data.iterrows():
        future = executor.submit(self._send_single_confirmation_optimized, reservation)
        future_to_reservation[future] = reservation
    
    # Collect results as they complete
    for future in as_completed(future_to_reservation):
        result = future.result()
```

**Impact**: Email processing time reduced from ~3 minutes to ~18 seconds (90% improvement)

#### 3. Memory Management
**Optimizations Applied**:
- Delete large objects after use: `del raw_data; gc.collect()`
- Process data in chunks for larger datasets
- Efficient pandas operations to minimize memory copies

**Impact**: Memory usage remains stable (~72MB) vs growing memory in original

### Performance Results

| Metric | Original (Buggy) | Fixed | Optimized | Total Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Runtime** | 334.22s | 192.25s | **18.51s** | **94.5% faster** |
| **Records/sec** | 0.6 | 1.0 | **9.94** | **1560% improvement** |
| **Memory Usage** | 44.59 MB | 61.72 MB | 72.48 MB | Stable |
| **Email Success Rate** | 98% | 99.5% | **97.8%** | Maintained |
| **Data Quality** | Poor | Good | **Excellent** | Consistent filtering |

### Key Performance Decisions

1. **Pandas Vectorization**: Replaced row-by-row loops with vectorized operations using pandas built-in methods
2. **Concurrent Processing**: Used ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound email operations with 5 worker threads
3. **Memory Optimization**: Implemented garbage collection and deleted large objects after processing
4. **Error Handling**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
5. **Batch Processing**: Grouped operations to reduce overhead

### Before/After Code Comparison

#### Data Processing Optimization
```python
# BEFORE: Inefficient row-by-row processing (2.3 seconds)
def process_reservations(self, data):
    processed_records = []
    for index, row in data.iterrows():  # Slow iteration
        processed_record = self._process_single_reservation(row)
        if processed_record:
            processed_records.append(processed_record)
        time.sleep(0.01)  # Artificial delay
    return pd.DataFrame(processed_records)

# AFTER: Vectorized operations (0.01 seconds)  
def clean_data_optimized(self, data):
    # All operations are vectorized pandas operations
    data_clean = data.drop_duplicates(subset=['PNR'], keep='first')
    data_clean['Fare'] = data_clean['Fare'].apply(clean_fare)
    
    # Vectorized filtering - processes all rows at once
    data_clean = data_clean[
        (data_clean['Origin'].isin(valid_airports)) & 
        (data_clean['Destination'].isin(valid_airports)) &
        (data_clean['Origin'] != data_clean['Destination']) &
        (data_clean['Status'].isin(self.valid_statuses)) &
        (data_clean['Fare'] > 0)
    ]
    return data_clean
```

#### Email Processing Optimization
```python
# BEFORE: Synchronous email sending (180+ seconds)
def send_confirmations(self, reservations_data):
    results = []
    for index, reservation in reservations_data.iterrows():
        result = self._send_single_confirmation(reservation)
        results.append(result)
        time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms delay per email
    return results

# AFTER: Concurrent email sending (18 seconds)
def send_confirmations_optimized(self, reservations_data):
    results = []
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        # Submit all tasks concurrently
        future_to_reservation = {
            executor.submit(self._send_single_confirmation_optimized, reservation): reservation
            for index, reservation in reservations_data.iterrows()
            if not pd.isna(reservation.get('Email'))
        }
        
        # Collect results as they complete
        for future in as_completed(future_to_reservation):
            results.append(future.result())
    return results
```

## Reflection (200 words)

**What was the most challenging part?**
The most challenging aspect was identifying performance bottlenecks hidden within seemingly innocuous code. The 10ms sleep in the data processing loop and 100ms delays in email sending weren't immediately obvious as the primary performance killers. Debugging required systematic profiling and step-by-step analysis to isolate each component's impact.

**Where did Copilot help—and where did you step in?**
GitHub Copilot was invaluable for scaffolding the initial data generation script and suggesting vectorized pandas operations. It quickly provided the ThreadPoolExecutor implementation for concurrent email processing. However, I had to step in for the strategic debugging process—Copilot couldn't identify the logical flow issues in validation filtering or understand the performance implications of row-by-row processing. The optimization strategy and architectural decisions required human insight.

**What did you learn about debugging and optimization?**
This exercise reinforced that optimization is as much about eliminating inefficiencies as adding clever algorithms. The 94.5% performance improvement came primarily from removing artificial delays and replacing O(n) row operations with vectorized O(1) operations. I learned that profiling tools like cProfile are essential for identifying actual vs. perceived bottlenecks. Most importantly, I discovered that production-ready automation requires thinking beyond "does it work?" to "does it work efficiently and reliably at scale?"
